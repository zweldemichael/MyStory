# MyStory

Goal:
	The goal of the project is to create a story journal where users can write stories about their day tagging the story with a visual representation (a picture) that expresses how their day went. “A picture is worth a thousand word”

Scope:
	The scope of the project would include working on the user analysis next week. The next step would be using the android studio in the next few weeks to start developing the application, using Firebase for storing the database for the login details and history. 

Application Type: 
	It will be a mobile application available across all Android phones

Users Targeted:
		Users targeted would be the storyteller, writers, users that love to write

Brief Description:
		 A journal app where you can record your daily activities and write stories about the events that happened during the day. The main page would contain a list of stories you have written already (like the way google photo displays your past photo) and using photos from the story (to make it appealing). Each story would have pictures that go along with the notes of the journal, and each story automatically records the date and time for you. This way it's easy to look back at memories. Other features include a calendar view and sharing the story, Search for past events (stories) and Being able to enter the story via audio (optional). THE NAME OF THE APP WOULD BE CALLED MY STORY.


List of Technologies used in the project:
-	Andriod studio: it will be our platform for creating the journal mobile application
-	Firebase: will store the database of the project
-	Android phone: to deploy and test the working app
